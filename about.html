<body>
  <p>
    Leonardo Da Vinci is an accomplished Florentine artist, responsible for revolutionizing paintings techniques as we
    know it. </p>

  <p>
    Born in Florence, Leonardo began painting and sculpting at age 14. Later in life, he became one of the most
    respected artists of the Italian Renaissance, earning the patronage of both the Catholic Church and the Florentine
    political elite.
  </p>
  <p>Eventually, Leonardo decided to become an independent artist, where he sells prints of his old works and paints
    commissions.
